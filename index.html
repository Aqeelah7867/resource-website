<h3 id="chapter2"> The History Of Embroidery</h3>
<p> 20th Century to Today: Embroidery as Art and Fashion</p>
<p> In the early 20th century, embroidery became a key element of haute couture, with designers like Chanel and Dior incorporating it into their fashion lines.
    The mid-century saw a rise in hobbyist embroidery, with cross-stitch and needlepoint becoming popular.
    In the 21st century, embroidery has experienced a revival as both a traditional craft and a modern art form, blending hand and machine techniques to create unique designs. It is now used in fashion, interior design, and even digital embroidery.
    With advancements in technology, embroidery is more accessible than ever, from hand-stitching traditions to high-tech digital embroidery machines. Despite these changes, the essence of embroidery remains the same—it's a craft that connects history, culture, and creativity across generations.
